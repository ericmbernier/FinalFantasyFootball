## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Eric Bernier__
> Sleeper: @eburn


### Commissioner Site Powers ###
- The commissioner has the ability (ONLY in situations deemed appropriate) to edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, force/veto trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams. 

### Dispute Arbitration ###
- The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. If the commissioner is involved in a dispute it is up to the league to settle matters accordingly. 

### Rule Changes ###
#### Nomination ####
- In order to nominate a rule change, simply propose such change via the league chat on Sleeper. If the change gets endorsed (by adding an emoji showing your affirmation) by 2 additional league members it will be on the docket for the end of year voting.
#### End of Year Voting / Passing A Rule ####
- Upon each season's end we will vote on any nominated proposals. A rule needs 7/10 yes votes for it to pass. There are no exceptions.

### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will ONLY be vetoed if there is EXTREMELY evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid. Colluders will not be given infractions, and will be immediately removed.**

### Tanking ###
-Tanking is not tolerated. Trading all of your players away so that your roster is worse, netting you better picks is not considered tanking. Arguments such as "it is my money and I can do what I want with it" does not carry water, as your actions affect other league members and what happens with their money. If a team is expected to be purposely tanking the team owner   will receive a warning the first time, followed by loss of a 1st round draft pick, and lastly removal from the league and forfeiture of buyin(s).


## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The entry fee for the league is $30 per season, with two seasons required upfront. 
- Players must have already paid the two-season startup payment before being permitted to draft.

### Yearly Dues ###
- After the first year there is a yearly fee of $30 to continue participating in the league.
- Payment must be paid at minimum a month before the rookie draft. 

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated payment date then they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie). It will be the commissioner's decision on whether or not to grant an extension.

- Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
- FAAB dollars are tradeable
- There is a one day waiting period for waivers to clear
- Free agency locks a week after the championship ends, through the end of the rookie draft. 
- Daily waivers will be used throughout the season and offseason.
- Free Agents lock at their respective gametimes and remain locked until the first round of daily waivers resolve for the week (Wednesdays). 


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away. There is no league vote and there is no commissioner vote. If collusion is suspected alert the commissioner.
- Trading is allowed throughout the entire offseason. 
- The trade deadline is week 12. All rosters lock week 13, a week before the start of the post-season. 
- You must pay any years' fees for any draft picks you trade. If you trade for/away draft pick for the 2022 season then you must have paid the league dues for the 2022 season.


## __Section VI - Startup Draft__ ##
- Snake format (1st to 10th then 10th to 1st).
- The draft will start with a randomized lottery, listing the teams 1-->10. The first team has first choice of where they want to draft in the startup draft. They can pick any of the available ten draft spots. This process repeats until all teams have chosen an available draft spot.
- Each day the draft will last from 8AM to 11PM EST with each team having 4 hours per pick.
- Trading draft picks is allowed during the startup draft.
- If a team misses their pick the best available player based on [these rankings](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/dynasty-overall.php) will be taken for them.


## __Section VII - Rookie Draft__ ##

### Rookie Draft Order ###
- The draft order for the rookie draft will be determined based on both regular and post-season results
- Picks 1-5 will be assigned in inverse order of the regular season standings.
- Picks 6-10 will be assigned in inverse order of the postseason standings

### Rookie Draft Settings ###
- There will be 3 rounds of the rookie draft.
- The rookie draft will take place a week after the NFL draft concludes (give, or take a few days, depending on how busy everyone is.)
- The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, etc.)
- Each day the draft will last from 8AM to 11PM EST with each team having 4 hours per pick.
- Trading draft picks is allowed during the rookie draft
- If a team misses their pick the best available player based on [these rankings](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/rookies.php) will be taken for them

__Any undrafted rookie will be treated as a common FA. If they are unavailable in the database you must message the commissioner to claim them and leave a spot open on your roster once they confirm your request. If no spot is open when the player becomes available then there will be no priority given to the team that claimed them__


## __Section VIII - Schedule__ ##

### Regular Season Schedule ###
- The regular season lasts from week 1 to week 13.
- Playoffs begin week 14, with the championship game occuring week 16.


## __Section IX - Playoffs__ ##

### Championship Bracket ###
- The two teams with the best regular season records will be assigned to the top two seeds, and receive a first round bye. There are NO divisions in this league.
- The next three teams will be assigned their playoff seeding spot based on regular season record.
- The sixth seed is the last remaining team with the MOST points scored during the regular season.

### Consolation Bracket ###
- Seeding will be determined by end of regular season standings for the 6 teams not in the Championship Bracket.
- The winner of the consolation ladder will be awarded an extra pick at the end of the first round (1.11).
- The consolation bracket has no bearing on draft order.

## __Section XI - Leaving the League__ ##
### Leaving the League ###
- In the event that you wish to quit the league, you must let the league know upon completion of the current season. Life happens, play out the season you paid up for, and let's all move on quickly. The sooner the league knows the easier it is to find a replacement owner, and the sooner things can go back to normal. 
- If you are not willing to play out the current season, you forfeit the money that you have paid, and the commissioner will make all of your start/sit decisions based on Sleeper's highest projections. No trades will be made, nor free agent signings. 
- In drastic circumstances the commissioner may consider refunding the buy-in, however, these instances will be very rare and far from the expectation.

### Missing Teams ###
- In many instances where owners quit and leave it is due to the fact that the team is in miserable shape. We can attempt to offer new members an agreed upon discounted rate for their first season, or even a free season to encourage them to begin rebuilding their new team. Often times, even with this financial incentive, it can be tough to find a replacement owner. In the sake of keeping the league together the commissioner reserves the right to offer compensatory picks at the end of each round of the draft. 
- In even rarer circumstances, the commish reserves the right to waive the 2nd year fee for an orphaned team. During these discounted years the pot would be short, and such shortage would get evenly deducted from all winners' rewards. 
- In the event of not having 12 teams by the rookie draft, we will postpone the draft by a month, each month, until the season starts.
- If an owner is still not found, the league will vote on whether to shrink in size (down to 10) or disburse.
- If multiple owners leave at the same time, all affected players will be merged into a player pool, and new owners will conduct a snake-format draft to select their teams. 

## __Section XII - Misc__ ##
- In the case that there is a discrepancy between the rules on Sleeper and the rules stated here, please inform the commissioner immediately. If for some reason the commissioner is unavailable, the rules on Sleeper take precedence. 
- Trash talk is a great part of the game. However, please do not be hateful or bully other members. Such behavior will NOT be tolerated.
- Treat eachother with respect.
